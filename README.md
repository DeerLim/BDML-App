#ConcreteData_H fold contains code, pre-processed data for analysis and expriment results for Concrete dataset.
Used method is HDSSL corresponding to the given paper.
Predicted variable is numerical type, and the reconstructed difference is a little big.

#WDBCData_H fold contains code, pre-processed data for analysis and expriment results for WDBC dataset.
Used method is HDSSL corresponding to the given paper.
Predicted variable is categorical type, and the reconstructed difference is quite big.

#WDBCData_V fold contains code, raw data for analysis and expriment results for WDBC dataset.
Used method is VDSSL corresponding to the given paper.
predicted variable is categorical type, and the reconstructed differnce is quite big and which is even bigger than HDSSL method.

#The code is compiled using python. .ipynb files and .py files contains same code.
